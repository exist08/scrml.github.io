            <p>Welcome to the SCRML homepage!</p>
            <div class="blurb">
                <h3>Is this Math?</h3>
                <p>You have found yourself on the home page of a project in mathematics. What some people think math is can be very different than what other people think, so we need to make some things clear right away. This is a project in <em>abstract</em> math, which you may or may not have explicit experience with. Fear not: we will not be delving into lofty and difficult concepts on this site. Instead we are interested more in discovering what math looks like to people who have fallen in love with it. Yes, we exist, and we can be normal people too -- math is beautiful if you catch it in the right light.</p>
                <p>Everybody has at some point enjoyed something which a mathematician would consider math. Have you ever solved a problem (not just in the classroom but anywhere in life) by thinking about it, even if it required a few steps to solve? It feels good when a plan works as designed, right? Have you ever enjoyed playing a game according to the rules because following the rules provides a challenge and that is where the fun lies? These images are much more what we mean when talking about math, at least here on this website, than pages and pages of furiously scribbled calculations.</p>
                <p>Let's see an example of the type of math we are talking about here. Suppose we are playing tic-tac-toe. I am X and you are O, the board is as below and it is your turn.</p>
                <table class="tictactoe">
                    <tr><td/><td>O</td><td/></tr>
                    <tr><td>O</td><td>X</td><td/></tr>
                    <tr><td/><td>X</td><td/></tr>
                </table>
                <p>Where do you choose? If you see that choosing the top-left corner will guarantee you a win, then you have just done some abstract math. How do you know that you will win if you choose the top-left corner? If you wanted to be a good sport, would you be able to explain to me why you are certain that you will win? This type of thinking is a large part of what we do when we do math. We see an answer to some question and we try to describe our answer in a way which is irrefutably correct and which others can understand and follow.</p>
                <p>It is this irrefutability of solutions that appeals so much to so many mathematicians. It is not my fault, or yours, that the board above can guarantee you a win. That's just how the game works. Sure, you could say it is my fault (and yours) that the board ended up as above, but that's not the question. The question is that, starting with that particular board, what happens?</p>
                <p>As mathematicians, we can see the outcome of the game <em>before</em> you actually place three Os in a row. The reasoning we perform when understanding this is fundamental logic and basic analysis, and with some simple tools like these we can understand behavior of systems such as this game. In general that's all math is -- seing what things we can be absolutely certain of given some initial information and being able to prove it with basic reasoning.</p>
                <p>We mathematicians like to invent our own problems once we get the hang of it because it can be fun to challenge yourself with your own questions. As we get better, we can change the type of questions we look at too. A large part of math is coming up with the right settings where we can ask the right questions and find neat ways to answer them. The motivation here is self-apparent: we do it because it is fun to do.</p>
                <p>There is another, perhaps less universally familiar, reason that people fall in love with math. As we see more and more of what other mathematicians have come up with, we start seeing connections between branches of math that seemed totally unrelated. Some questions about the best way to tie a knot can be answered with the same tools used to solve combination puzzles like the Rubik's cube. Some calculations which are too complicated to do directly can be done instead with pictures of ways to fold sheets of rubber without cutting the sheets. Many people love math because of the endless connections between what seemed like completely unrelated concepts, and the deeper you go the more connections you find. I promised at the beginning that we wouldn't get into deep topics, though, so we should move on.</p>

                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>(under construction -- need to transition to talking about proofs)</p>
                <p>Proofs are a particular way of thinking that many students struggle with when first learning. Proofs are given in natural language (English) but there are rigid structural rules sentences must follow in order to be considered valid. This is especially true for key logical words like "or, and, not, if, suppose." Additionally if a transition word like "thus" or "therefore" is out of place the proof becomes confusing, if not absolutely incorrect.</p>
                <p>The rigid structure of proofs seems familiar to those of us who know a computer programming language. With computers, syntax is essential. Any small deviation from the required structure will halt execution of the program. Likewise, a small change in wording in a proof can turn a perfectly valid statement into total nonsense. Perhaps more insidiously, a small change in wording can turn one sentence into another valid sentence but completely change the meaning, a phenomenon all too familiar to anyone who has had to debug a program.</p>
                <p>The similarities between mathematical proofs and computer programs does not end with structural rigidity. Perhaps more importantly, both are treated as absolutely and inherently consistent. That is, computers do not make mistakes when executing code -- the mistakes come from code design (we won't consider hardware malfunctions). Likewise a proof is, by virtue of being a proof, always correct. If an attempted proof is incorrect then we do not say that something is wrong with proof itself, we say that something is wrong with the argument given as proof (sometimes we call the argument a proof, which may be confusing now, but we can always distinguish between a proposed argument and a valid proof). In both situations problems are assumed to come from either the author for making a mistake or the consumer for misinterpreting the material. The material itself is infallibly consistent and purely logical.</p>
                <p>Recognizing this leads us to the point of this project: computers should be able to understand abstract mathematics in the same way that we mathematicians do. Obiously we cannot expect creativity or ingenuity from a computer, and a computer cannot understand the beauty or appeal of mathematics, but a computer should be able to read an argument and check if it makes sense or not, provided we have determined the qualifications for what a statement is and what it means to make sense. This project aims to create a language in which we can make mathematical statements in such an unambiguous and uniform way that a computer can process it, and to have algorithmic checks in place to define what we mean by making sense. Moreover we would like the language to be as immediately recognizable as possible to the everyday mathematician. Any person who is familiar with the standard concepts of mathematical proof should be able to write statements in this language with a minimal amount of esoteric knowledge about the language itself.</p>
                <p>The goal is specifically to develop a language for computers to understand mathematical statements, what we make them then do with the statements is left for future projects. This language was born from an idea about a cheesy video game designed to teach calculus. The idea is that the game is an RPG where the player explores a medieval fantasy world full of goblins, ogres, dragons, and other monsters. Any encounter with a monster initiates a fight which consists of the monster asking calculus questions. The player has a toolbelt of all the theorems learned so far, and they try to piece together a solution using these theorems. If they succeed then they progress in the game, and if not they turn around and explore for more theorems. The world would be populated with friendly villagers who show example problems tohelp the player along.</p>
                <p>The key part of this game is that the player is capable of creating their own theorems to add to the toolbelt during gameplay. This is different from the standard approach of fill-in-the-blank until the correct answer is obtained. In this game a clever player could create the solution to any question as long as the solution is correct -- even questions the game's author does not know how to solve. Doing this requires that the computer running the game has a way of checking if the solution is correct. It also requires that the player know the language used to construct solutions, so this language should be matched as closely as possible to the existing standard format of mathematical communication. Hence we have motivation to create this language. Of course, there are other potential applications for the language too.</p>

                <h3>What is GRML/SCRML?</h3>
                <p>There are two aspects to this language: the abstract mathematical side and the physical computer side. The former is called GRML, or <span class="acronym">Rigorous Mathematics Language with Graphs</span>. It is described in <a href="GRML/main.pdf">this paper</a>. We will not delve into pure GRML on this website. Instead we focus on the latter aspect of the language, which we call SCRML.</p>
                <p>SCRML is a markup language which encapsulates the goal of the overarching project. The acronym SCRML stands for <span class="acronym">Self Contained Resources Markup Language</span>. SCRML is an XML-based file format for making mathematical statements. That means mathematical statements are saved in files which are ultimately text files with some special syntax rules. As such they can be created and edited in any text editor. This website will eventually host a SCRML editor, but that is still in production.</p>
                <p>Mathematical statements made into SCRML files are designed to be compiled. This website will also host a compiler, also currently in production. When a SCRML file is successfully compiled, we treat it as a consistent, valid mathematical statement. The meaning behind these statements will be described, piece by piece, in the coming sections.</p>
