            <p>Welcome to the home site of SCRML! SCRML (Self-Contained Resources Markup Language) is a markup language designed for abstract mathematics. This site will house all SCRML documentation and will host a SCRML editor so you the user can easily read, write, and compile SCRML files. There will also be a few pages devoted to introducing abstract mathematics to the general population and decribing the motivation behind SCRML as well as some potential applications.</p>
