    <p>There are two aspects to this language: the abstract mathematical side and the physical computer side. The former is called GRML, or <span class="acronym">Rigorous Mathematics Language with Graphs</span>. It is described in <a href="GRML/main.pdf">this paper</a>. We will not delve into pure GRML on this website. Instead we focus on the latter aspect of the language, which we call SCRML.</p>
    <p>SCRML is a markup language which encapsulates the goal of the overarching project. The acronym SCRML stands for <span class="acronym">Self Contained Resources Markup Language</span>. SCRML is an XML-based file format for making mathematical statements. That means mathematical statements are saved in files which are ultimately text files with some special syntax rules. As such they can be created and edited in any text editor. This website will eventually host a SCRML editor, but that is still in production.</p>
    <p>Mathematical statements made into SCRML files are designed to be compiled. This website will also host a compiler, also currently in production. When a SCRML file is successfully compiled, we treat it as a consistent, valid mathematical statement. The meaning behind these statements will be described, piece by piece, in the coming sections.</p>
