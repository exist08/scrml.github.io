                <summary>How to use</summary>
                <p>This editor is very much still under construction, so a lot of the features described are not actually implemented yet. I do my best to describe which ones are not ready.</p>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>SCRML statements are by nature self-contained, which means they have to be built from scratch. However, when attempting to develop any mathematical theory from scratch, it is very common to alter the structure as progress is made. We don't start off with the perfect formulations for the foundations but instead discover what the structure should be as we go. Making an alteration to any given SCRML statement requires making corresponding alterations to any SCRML file which references that statement, so it quickly becomes tedious to write a mathematical theory in SCRML by hand. This editor is designed to handle all the tedium involved with writing SCRML files, letting you the author focus on the mathematical structure you are building.</p>
                <p>The editor is essentially a repository of SCRML files. We call these statements. Constructing a mathematical theory in SCRML amounts to constructing statements to build up the background, then more statements to build up the tools, then even more statements with the interesting theorems and their proofs. Obviously there is (will be) a way to create new statements in this editor. The editor will also keep track of which statements successfully compile and will alert you if any don't.</p>
                <p>There are, additionally, other features to help us organize the vast number of statements necessary to construct a meaningful body of mathematics. All the statements are organized by a chapter system, complete with automated numbering and arbitrary levels of nesting. You can even add (not yet ready) comments, which are not SCRML at all but are just exposition to help organize ideas.</p>
                <p>Eventually this editor will also have means of keeping track of the theory as a whole. That is, it will show you which results depend on which, which ones have been proven to be equivalent, and which claims have been left unproven. These features are important, of course, but let's start with the basics.</p>
                <h4>Chapter System</h4>
                <p>The first thing you see when opening a blank sheet is a chapter called "Book." You can (not yet) rename this chapter by clicking on the title. The name must be a valid XML tag name, which means it must follow various syntax rules such as no spaces or commas are allowed. There is a section below with more specific information about naming should you need it. You can optionally give the chapter a nickname and this nickname can be any string you wish. Click the (not ready) toggle icon next to the name to switch between node-syntax official name and the nickname.</p>
                <p>Each chapter has contents called pages. Initially there are no pages, there is only a gap. Clicking on this gap will offer a chance to input a name which, if done successfully, inserts a new page in the specified position with the given name. A page is either a comment, a statement, or another chapter. Clicking the corresponding button at the top toggles between which types of pages are added with this process. Each type of page has a similar naming mechanism, with the strictly regulated node name used as an official identifier and the much more lenient nicknames which are used for organization and/or presentation.</p>
                <p>Pages are free to move about. Hovering the mouse over the name of a page brings up a toolbar on the right. The button labeled "â‡³" is the move button. Clicking it puts the page into move mode. All visible gaps turn green or red, depending on whether the page can be moved to that position or not. Clicking a green gap moves the page. To cancel the move simply click the move button again. If a chapter is moved it takes along all of its pages, too.</p>
                <p>Chapters can (soon) also be deleted. This is the red button next to the move button. Deleting a chapter will cause all the pages to move up a level, taking the place which the chapter itself used to occupy. The topmost chapter, the one which started with the name "Book," cannot be deleted.</p>
